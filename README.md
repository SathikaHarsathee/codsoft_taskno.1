Project Highlights:
     Visualized Genre Distribution: Utilized Seaborn to create a countplot showcasing the distribution of genres in the training dataset.Genre Trends Exploration: Implemented a scatterplot to explore genre trends based on cumulative counts, providing insights into the dataset's structure.Genre Distribution Barplot: Created a barplot to visualize the distribution of genres, offering a comprehensive view of the dataset's genre composition.

Data Cleaning:
     Text Cleaning Pipeline: Developed a robust text cleaning pipeline using NLTK and regular expressions to preprocess textual data effectively.Length Distribution Visualization: Utilized Seaborn to create a histogram, showcasing the distribution of cleaned text lengths in the training dataset.

Genre Prediction Model:
   Text Vectorization: Applied TfidfVectorizer for text vectorization, converting textual data into a format suitable for machine learning models. Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier: Implemented a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for genre prediction, achieving good accuracy on the validation set.Model Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance using accuracy metrics, a classification report, and confusion matrix.

Word Cloud Visualization:
    Word Cloud Generation: Utilized the WordCloud library to generate a visually appealing word cloud representation of the cleaned text data.

Results and Output:
    Predicted Genres: Appended the predicted genres to the test dataset and exported the results to a CSV file named 'predicted_genres.csv'.Visual Inspection: Displayed the test dataset with predicted genres to inspect the model's performance on unseen data.

Skills Acquired:
     Text Preprocessing: Developed skills in cleaning and preprocessing textual data, enhancing data quality for analysis. Machine Learning Modeling: Applied machine learning techniques, specifically the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, for genre prediction. Data Visualization: Utilized Seaborn and Matplotlib for creating insightful visualizations, enhancing data interpretation.

This project aims to classify genres based on textual descriptions, offering a comprehensive exploration of data cleaning, machine learning modeling, and visualization techniques.
